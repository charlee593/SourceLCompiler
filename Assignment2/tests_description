************************************************************** Passing tests **
For the passing tests we used our A1 test cases as basic guidelines:

A1a.488
	Uses all arithmetic, logical and comparison	operators. It also uses a
	simple anonymus parameterless function.

A1b.488
	Uses arrays including all forms of array declaration, including positive
	and negative bounds. 

A1c.488
	Uses all forms of loop building and loop exit constructs demonstrated
	multiple ways.

A1d.488
	Uses non-recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters.
	It also demonstrates how spacing can applied in the Source Language.

A1e.488
	Uses recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters
	including nested procedures nested function declarations.

empty_scope.488
	Tests whether an empty_scope would be accepted on its own. This was the
	base case.


Furthermore we created more passing tests to test more complex programs
which were expected to be valid:

expression.488
	Tests more complex expressions. It tests mainly for more parenthesis,
	however also tests some important corner cases.

nested.488
	Is a complex program that contains nested loops, nested if statements,
	nested function declaration and scopes, all of which are syntactically
	correct.

no_indentation.488
	Tests a simple, correct program which only uses spaces for delimiting
	(i.e. no indentation).


************************************************************** Failing tests **
In the failing directory there are the following files:

add.488 
	Missing an expression in between addition expression.

alpha_array_bound.488
	Array bound is an alpha character.

array_assignment.488
	Arrayname missing expression.

array_param.488
	Passing an array parameter to a function statement.

direct_assignment.488
	Missing declaration. 

empty_brackets.488
	Between the parentheses, it misses an arguments.

empty_if.488
	Missing an expression in the in statement.

empty_param_funct.488
	Function has empty param list.

empty_param_proc.488
	Procedure has empty param list.

freestanding_put.488
	Put without output.

freestanding_text.488
	Text without a put statement.

exit_1.488
	Missing an expression in the exit conditional statement.

invalid_get_usage.488
	Input uses illegal variable input.

invalid_negation.488
	Negation ! has lower precedence than the comparison expression.

invalid_statement.488
	Lack statement in scope.

invalid_yields.488
	Yields expression lack a statement.

keyword_variable.488
	Using keyword as variable. 

missing_array_bound_1.488
	Array is missing bounds within brackets.

missing_array_bound_2.488
	Array is missing upper bound.

missing_array_bound_3.488
	Array is missing lower bound.

missing_begin.488
	Scope is missing 'begin'.

missing_end.488
	Scope is missing 'end'.

negative_array_bound.488
	The bound can only be non-negative integer inside the variable name. 

no_do_whileloop.488
	While statement lack the 'do' keyword.

no_param_funct_1.488
	Assignment of the function has to be either just functionname or
	functionname(arguments).

no_param_funct_2.488
	Assignment of the function has expression instead of arguments.

no_parantheses_return.488
	Expression return has to be either just return or return with parenthesis
	enclosing expression.

no_type_function.488
	Function is missing a return type.

threeway_comparison.488
	Valid if it has parenthesis to one of the comparison expression.

type_procedure.488
	Procedure has a return type.

unmatched_array_bracket_1.488
	Array size declaration has an unmatched left square bracket.

unmatched_array_bracket_2.488
	Array size declaration has an unmatched right square bracket.

unmatched_quote.488
	Unmatched quotation around text.
NOTE: DUE TO THE WAY THE .FLEX FILE HANDLES QUOTES, THIS TEST WILL SUCCEED. THE END OF LINE
      MARKERS ARE TREATED THE SAME AS QUOTATION MARKS. AS WE CANNOT CHANGE THE .FLEX FILE,
      WE CANNOT FIX THIS ISSUE. IT IS INCLUDED AS A REMINDER TO GET THE .FLEX FILE CHANGED
      AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
 
variable_declaration_1.488
	The declaration lack a variable name in between the commas. 

variable_declaration_2.488
	Identifier cannot start with a number.

variable_declaration_3.488
	Identifier cannot start with a symbol.
