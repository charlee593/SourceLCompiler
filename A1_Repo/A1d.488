% A program using non-recursive functions and procedures with and without parameters
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
begin
    % Description:
    %     Calculates the gcd(greatest common divisor) of two integers.
    %     This is a non-recursive function with parameters.
    %     The inappropriate coding style is intentional and is meant to test how robust
    %     the compiler is.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %     a and b - The numbers for which gcd is to be calculated
    %
    % Returns:
    %     gcd(a, b)
    integer function gcd(integer a, integer b)
    begin if a< 0 
        then a < = - a end
        if 
        0>b
        then b<= -b end
        if a =0 &! b then return (0)
        end
        while b do integer c c <= a-b*(a/ b) a < = b b <   =c end
        begin
            return (a)
        end
    end
    
    % Description:
    %     Prints the nth Fibonacci number.
    %     Assuming that Fibonacci series starts with 1,1,2,...
    %     This is a non-recursive procedure with parameter.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %     n - The index of the Fibonacci number to be printed
    procedure print_fib(integer n)
    begin
        integer a, b
        a <= 1
        b <= 1
        while n > 2 do

    % Description:
    %     Prints "Hello World!" n times.
    %     n is received from standard input using get
    %     This is a non-recursive procedure without parameter.

    % Description:
    %     Caclulates the sum of 1 to n
    %     n is received from standard input using get
    %     This is a non-recursive function without parameter.
