    % Description:
    %   This function takes no parameters. It sipmly prints
    %   a message and returns true.

    % Returns:
    %   true

    % Description:
    %     Calculates the gcd(greatest common divisor) of two integers.
    %     This is a non-recursive function with parameters.
    %
    % Arguments:
    %     a and b - The numbers for which gcd is to be calculated
    %
    % Returns:
    %     gcd(a, b)
    integer function gcd(integer a, integer b)

    %     Prints the nth Fibonacci number.
    %     Assuming that Fibonacci series starts with 1,1,2,...
    %     This is a non-recursive procedure with parameter.

    % Arguments:
    %     n - The index of the Fibonacci number to be printed

    %     Prints "Hello World!" n times.
    %     n is received from standard input using get
    %     This is a non-recursive procedure without parameter.
